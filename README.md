Repository for Mobile Application Development FBLA project


Hello, and welcome to the Mobile Application Development project ManageMy Chapter! 

My name is Emma Johnson (the creator of this app), and I will be showing you around the code I have put together.

The first thing you should know about me is that my background is primarily based in HTML, CSS, and Ruby. To be able to build in the languages I was most comfortable using, I did some research and found that there are functions to take web based apps and shift them to mobile apps using the ionic framework - which ensures that code functions on all platforms and is not limited to just Android or just iOS. 

My documentation throughout this code will be labeled chronologically so that you, the reader, can follow my train of thought throughout the process. This project was started on Saturday, Nov. 02, 2019.
